**Today's Progress**: 

**Thoughts:**

### Day 05: November 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did a LAB 1 of IBM Hyperledger and dived into hyperledger composer language a bit. Completed ES6 challenges on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I suggest suspect I like the course and will consider paying for its certification in a few days. Also, will prefer doing blockchain & smart contracts without the ibm clound.

**Links:** NA

### Day 06: December 01, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did some lectures on Pirple Masterclass, Coursera Blockchain, and struggled with some CSS for a webpage.

**Thoughts:** I didnn't code much today. Barely 1 or 2 hours including the lectures. But did whatever I could, counting external factors. :] I also researched and devised a solution for a front end problem.

**Link to work:** NA

**For Next Day:** Will try implementing that solution and beginning the last responsive web design project of FCC. Also, hopefully do something in PHP+SQL.

### Day 07: December 03, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started Datacamp's course intro to python for data science, some progress in Regex.

**Thoughts:** What's keeping me from completing the regex is its length, will try to find out an appropiate day and complete it asap making notes along the way.

**Link to work:** NA

**For next day:** NA

### Day 08: December 04, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Progress in nodejs masterclass, completed lists in datacamp's python course, some progress in Regex on FCC, some progress in Star program.

**Thoughts:** A productive day for some targets, though I slept when I shouldn't have and that wasted some time preventing self-expected progress. I already know python enough.

**Link to work:** N.A.

**For next day:** Completing DataCamp's functions, more progess in Regex and Nodejs. I already know *.py enough. Hence, will try completing basics asap and moving on to applications and numpy.

### Day 09: December 05, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed portfolio project of responsive web design

**Thoughts** Slower than I wanted it to be due to some unforseen situations. :P

**Link to Work:** https://github.com/Zircoz/freeCodeCamp/tree/master/responsive%20web%20design%20projects/portfolio

**For Next Day:** completing more of python intro on datacamp and let's see...


### Day 10: December 06, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed Datacamp's Intro to .py for Data Science; read Anaconda's Docs. :D

**Thoughts** It was exciting to know how powerful .py's libs are!

**Link to Work:** N.A.

**For Next Day:** Will do html5.canvas and try implementing it into star. Maybe, also some FCC Regex or Nodejs to avoid monotonicity.

### Day 11: December 07, 2018

**Today's progress:** Some of <canvas> from Mark Pilgrim's "HTML5: Up and running"

**Thoughts:** Not a single solution can work. Will need full days dedicated to try >1 solutions to star issue.

**Link to Work:** NA

**For Next Day:** More on above.

### Day 12: December 08, 2018

**Today's progress:** More work on star. Finalized up a solution I think will work. A product in a few days if everything goes right. 

**Thoughts:** N.A.

**Link to Work:** N.A.

**For Next Day:** N.A.

### Day 13: December 10, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Did more in canvas of HTML5. And a few lectures on blockchain.
 
**Thoughts:** Signing off early to begin shifting work schedule.

**Link to work:** NA

**For Next day:** More of the same.

### Day 14: December 11, 2018

**Today's progress:** Experimented with animations in canvas. 

**Thoughts:** NA

**Link to work:** NA

**For Next day:** More in canvas; trying to make it interactive; also read the API's code to see if it has some hints.

#### Day 15:  December 12, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Regex completed. Canvas basics and experiments over

**Thoughts:** Regex was quite tricky and mind bending; glad I didn't skip it, lol

**Link to Work:** NA

**For next day:** Canvas product can be expected soon...
