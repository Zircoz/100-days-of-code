### Day 5: November 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did a LAB 1 of IBM Hyperledger and dived into hyperledger composer language a bit. Completed ES6 challenges on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I suggest suspect I like the course and will consider paying for its certification in a few days. Also, will prefer doing blockchain & smart contracts without the ibm clound.

**Links:** NA

### Day 6: December 01, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did some lectures on Pirple Masterclass, Coursera Blockchain, and struggled with some CSS for a webpage.

**Thoughts:** I didnn't code much today. Barely 1 or 2 hours including the lectures. But did whatever I could, counting external factors. :] I also researched and devised a solution for a front end problem.

**Link to work:** NA

**For Next Day:** Will try implementing that solution and beginning the last responsive web design project of FCC. Also, hopefully do something in PHP+SQL.
